Context of the Directory:
    This directory was made for the DonorsChoose kaggle project where the goal is
    to determine the approval of a funding proposal from various teachers to the
    DonorsChoose Organization. The text analysis fields and their data analysis are
    used to predict approval of various projects for funding.

    The used data-frame (containing all relevant essays to be analyzed) can be found
    on Kaggle for the DonorsChoose project.
    (used as data_train in text_analysis_fields.py)

    Data frames can be changed as deemed necessary for various purposes
    Text-analysis fields  are, in part, courtesy of Attreya Bhatt (also has GitHub)
        - https://github.com/attreyabhatt/Sentiment-Analysis

This directory focuses on:
    - providing functions for basic text analysis using the NLTK library
    - initializing a new data frame with determined fields from text analysis
    - analyzing new data with decision trees
